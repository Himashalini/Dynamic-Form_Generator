# Dynamic Form Generator

This project is a dynamic form generator built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to create customizable forms based on dynamic JSON data, preview the generated form, and edit the JSON configuration.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Based on user-provided JSON configurations.
- **Form Preview**: Allows users to preview the form before submission.
- **JSON Editor**: Enables users to edit the form's JSON configuration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
